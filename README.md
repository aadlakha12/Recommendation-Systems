# Recommendation-Systems

Recommendation Engine which helps to get the similar items to users or items to similar users to recommend.
This Recommendation-Systems is based on collaborative filtering. It has two types user-user filtering and item-item filtering.

#### User-User Filtering

User-user filtering looks for the similarity between every individual user. It’s about the behavior of a user by collecting preferences from many users and can predict for similar user in future. If user A and user B has same preference for some item. It’s likely that they have same preference for other item as well rather than to other user C who has different preferences.

#### Item-Item Filtering

Item-item collaborative filtering, or item-based is an other type of collaborative filtering for recommendation engine based on the similarity between items calculated using user's ratings of those items. Item-item based filtering is considered to be most viable.

Cosine Similarity is used to find the similarity between the objects as similarity measure.

This is implemented with Book Dataset.

The Book dataset has 3 tables.
