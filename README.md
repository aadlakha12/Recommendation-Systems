# Recommendation-Systems

Recommendation Engine which helps to get the similar items to users or items to similar users to recommend.
This Recommendation-Systems is based on collaborative filtering. It has two types user-user filtering and item-item filtering.

#### User-User Filtering

User-user filtering looks for the similarity between every individual user. It’s about the behavior of a user by collecting preferences from many users and can predict for similar user in future. If user A and user B has same preference for some item. It’s likely that they have same preference for other item as well rather than to other user C who has different preferences.

#### Item-Item Filtering

Item-item collaborative filtering, or item-based is an other type of collaborative filtering for recommendation engine based on the similarity between items calculated using user's ratings of those items. Item-item based filtering is considered to be most viable.

Cosine Similarity is used to find the similarity between the objects as similarity measure.

Mathematically, it measures the cosine angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.

As an example we have two sets as following:

A = [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0]
B = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

We can apply cosine similarity on the above sets as following

Cos(A,B) = (2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 2*1 + 1*1)/√(2*2 + 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1)*√(2*2 + 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 +1*1 +1*1)
= > 9/9.9498 =0.9045


This is implemented with Book Dataset.

The Book dataset has 3 tables.

• Users
Contains the users. It has three columns User-ID, Location, Age.

• Books 
Contains books detail. Books are identified by their respective ISBN. It has ISBN,Book- Title, Book-Author, Year-Of-Publication, Publisher and URLs.

• Book-Ratings
Contains the book ratings information. Ratings are on a scale from 1-10. Higher values
denoting higher appreciation, otherwise, lower value less appreciation.
